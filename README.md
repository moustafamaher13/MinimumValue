# MinimumValue
get the minimum value of any list given

1) I created a function that returns the minimum value in a list of int
2) the function had to return int "which is the minimum value"
3) the funtion had to have a paramter which is the list of int
4) i created a for loop that take the 1st item in the list and made an if condition that checks if the 1st item is lower than the other or not
